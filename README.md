## Arc of Total Eclipse

[_Arc of Total Eclipse_](http://www.sarahcharlesworth.net/series-view.php?album_id=1449341&subalbum_id=1449503) by **Sarah Charlesworth** is a series of prints that
show the front-page prints of major newspapers around the United States on
February 26th, 1979.

The headline story of the day being the total solar eclipse that was visible
throughout the United States. These prints have edited out all text information
except for the newspapers' logo, date, edition, and weather information and has
kept only the images of the solar eclipse while also maintaining the newspapers
proportions. The result is a print of a mostly empty newspaper edition with repeating
images of the solar eclipse as witnessed by different locations throughout
the United States.

## Ode to Arc of Total Eclipse

_Ode to Arc of Total Eclipse_ is an homage piece by **Hector Leiva** that
replicates the same process by _Sarah Charlesworth_. The process is modified to
take into account the move from physical print to the virtual representation of
the front-page newspaper which is that newspaper's homepage online.

The process encompasses the following changes:

* The isolation of a single, nationally wide covered incident or event (does not have to be focused on a solar eclipse).
* The newspaper's internet home-page is now what was previously the newspapers' printed front-page.
* The end result will be a digital copy with hard-coded dimensions of the newspaper's largest possible representation of their internet home-page.
* This method in which these digital copies will be generated, will be completely automated by a custom computer program.
